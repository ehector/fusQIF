# fusQIF
Fused Quadratic Inference Functions

This is a repository for the R package to perform regression analysis of high-dimensional correlated responses. The approach divides data into blocks according to the supplied indicator, analyses blocks using quadratic inference functions, and then fuses blocks using ADMM and re-estimates parameters using optimal generalized method of moments (GMM) equation. The R package's main files are:
- src/QIF-fusion.cpp: this file defines the Rcpp functions that compute the objective functions.
- R/generate-datasets.R: this file defines the user-facing R functions for generating simulated data.
- R/estimation-funcs-package.R: this file defines the user-facing R function for the divide-and-conquer estimation of model parameters.

The fusQIF man file contains an example for running the regression model from the paper.

# Installation

The fusQIF R package can be installed in one of two ways:
- from the downloaded gzipped tarball as R CMD INSTALL fusQIF_1.0-1.tar.gz
- from the downloaded and renamed fusQIF folder as R CMD build fusQIF and R CMD INSTALL fusQIF_1.0-1.tar.gz

Please make sure to have all packages listed in the DESCRIPTION file already installed. If you encounter a library not found error for lgfortran, please try installing gfortran from here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/.
